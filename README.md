### In this repository you will find two folders: MyPathPlanning folder and TFODCourseYT

<br>

#### MyPathPlanning folder contains all of my code I used step by step like color detection, using roboflow API for object detection and motion planning to reach my final goal in this project. I hope to have made it simple to follow along and reproduce the steps.

#### The TFODCourseYT is a folder that is provided by Nicholas Renotte a youtuber who is very present in the world of object detection and recognition whos course I followed on youtube to learn about training models from scratch, engineering them and evaluating. In this folder I have some of myh scripts too and the models I have trained on my local machine.
