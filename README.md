# Repository Overview
### In this repository you will find two folders: MyPathPlanning folder and TFODCourseYT

<br>
<br>

## MyPathPlanning folder
#### The `MyPathPlanning` folder contains all of the code used in my project, including color detection, object detection using the roboflow API, and motion planning. I've made an effort to keep the code simple and easy to follow, so that others can reproduce the steps.

## TFODCourseYT folder
#### The `TFODCourseYT` folder contains materials from Nicholas Renotte's YouTube course on object detection and recognition. Nicholas is a well-known YouTuber in the field, and his course helped me to learn about training models from scratch, engineering them, and evaluating their performance. In this folder, you'll find some of my scripts and the models I've trained on my local machine. 

#### If you're interested in learning more about object detection and recognition, I highly recommend checking out Nicholas's course [here](Link to course).
